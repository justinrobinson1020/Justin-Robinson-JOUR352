        <!-- Body Text-->
        <p class="intro-text">
            <span class="dropcap">R</span>epublican state legislators across the country
            are introducing increasingly
            restrictive anti-abortion bills in the hopes of sending a case through the
            conservative-majority Supreme Court and possibly overturning Roe v. Wade.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            Over 500 abortion restrictions have been introduced in state legislatures this
            year, according to a report by the Guttmacher Institute. Compared to the same
            time in 2019, 300 abortion restrictions had been introduced, of which 59 were
            enacted. In 2020, there was less of a focus on abortion among state
            legislatures. Of the 236 abortion restrictions introduced, 27 were enacted.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            The latest anti-abortion bills are also more restrictive, such as a measure
            that recently passed in Arkansas and signed into law by Gov. Asa Hutchinson, a
            Republican. The law is an almost complete abortion ban, allowing the procedure
            only to save the life of the mother. It does not allow any exceptions in
            situations of rape or incest.
        </p>

                        for (var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])
                            for (var r = 0; r < t.length; r++) {
                                if (t[r].contentWindow === e.source) t[r]
                                    .style.height = e.data[

                            }

                }))
            }();
        </script>

        <p class="body-text">
            “It is not constitutional under Supreme Court cases right now,” Hutchinson
            said on CNN’s State of the Union on March 21, referring to the law he signed.
            “I signed it because it is a direct challenge to Roe v. Wade.”
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            If Roe v. Wade were to be overturned or weakened, abortion access would be at
            risk in 24 out of 50 states, according to Elisabeth Smith, chief counsel for
            state policy and advocacy at the Center for Reproductive Rights.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Missouri,
            Tennessee, South Dakota, and Utah are all states with “trigger bans.” Trigger
            bans are automatic abortion bans within the state should Roe v. Wade be
            overturned.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            “This lack of access would force those seeking an abortion to travel hundreds
            of miles, in some cases across multiple state lines, in order to receive
            care,” Smith told Capital News Service.

                Columbia

        </div>

        <p class="body-text">
            These abortion restrictions would have particularly harsh
            consequences for
            those who already face systemic barriers to healthcare, including people of
            color, people living in rural areas, those struggling to make ends meet, young
            people, and those in abusive relationships, Smith said.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            “Wealthy women will always find a way. They will have the resources…but poor
            women will not,” Dr. Laura Meyers, CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan
            District of Columbia, told CNS. “So of course, these laws disproportionately
            affect poor women.”
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            Texas is also looking to pass a trigger ban. The bill, which was passed by the
            Texas Senate on March 30, would prohibit almost all abortions.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            “This is not about discriminating against women. This is about giving the
            unborn a chance to live,” Texas State Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr., the only Democrat
            to co-sponsor the bill, said during a March 30 hearing.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            The bill would also make it a criminal offense for doctors to perform
            abortions. Those who perform abortions once the law goes into affect could be
            fined up to $100,000. In comparison, those who commit sexual assault are fined
            $10,000 under Texas law.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            Another piece of anti-abortion legislation passed by the Texas Senate on March
            30 would ban abortions once the fetus has a heartbeat, which is usually
            detected around six weeks into a pregnancy. Texas State Sen. Bryan Hughes, a
            Republican and lead author of the bill, said it is hard to argue with the fact
            that life begins with a heartbeat.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            “Texas is a pro-life state and this legislation reflects our continued
            commitment to protecting the most vulnerable,” Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a
            Republican, said in a statement. “I look forward to this lifesaving
            legislation being signed into law.”
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            The bills were advanced by a Texas House committee on April 15 and now go to
            the full House for debate.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            States are also pushing anti-abortion constitutional amendments, Smith said.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            At the start of this year, the Kansas legislature placed a constitutional
            amendment on the Aug. 2022 ballot that explicitly says the state constitution
            does not recognize a right to abortion. Iowa, Kentucky, and Oklahoma also
            moved to create ballot initiatives meant to restrict abortion rights.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            According to Meyers, these laws would have devastating effects on people,
            especially from a health perspective. If abortion were to somehow be banned,
            people would still find a way to seek an abortion, including self-administered
            abortions.

        <p class="body-text">
            “Rather than eliminating abortion, what you’re doing is making abortion
            unsafe,” Meyers said.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            A Pew Research Center poll in 2019 found that 70 percent of women do not
            support overturning Roe v. Wade, and 69 percent of men do not. A majority of
            Americans are more concerned that states are making it too difficult (59
            percent) than too easy (39 percent) to get an abortion.

            “There are no other circumstances where state legislatures and politicians
            step in to restrict access to healthcare,” Meyers said. “Can you imagine if a
            state started to step in to restrict access to appendectomies, or other
            life-saving care?”
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            “Abortion is health care. Abortion care is health care,” Meyers added.

        <p class="body-text">
            Despite the polls, many Republicans remain firm in their pro-life policies.
            Joshua Wilson, a University of Denver political science professor, credits
            this largely to the party’s white, evangelical following.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            The Christian right, Wilson said, consistently has turned out voters,
            volunteers, and leaders for the Republican Party.

        <p class="body-text">
            Although white evangelicals are only 15 to 20 percent of the population, they
            have made up approximately one quarter of the electorate for every
            presidential and mid-term election since 2012, according to data from the
            Public Religion Institute.

            White evangelicals are also deeply invested in fighting against abortion. A
            2019 Pew Research Center public opinion poll on abortion found that 77 percent
            of white evangelicals believed abortion should be illegal in all cases, the
            most anti-abortion opinion by any Christian religious group by far. The second
            closest was Catholics, at 42 percent.

            In the face of the vast amount of abortion restrictions being introduced in
            state legislatures, New Mexico is one of the only states to recently
            decriminalize abortion.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
            The Respect New Mexico Women and Families Act, signed into law by New Mexico
            Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, repealed New Mexico’s 1969 statute
            that criminalized abortion with few exceptions.
        </p>

        <p class="body-text">“A woman has the right to make decisions about her own body,”
            Grisham said in a
            statement. “Anyone who seeks to violate bodily integrity, or to criminalize
            womanhood, is in the business of dehumanization.”
